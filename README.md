# QGS-TT

This repository contains the code and results associated with the paper titled:  
**"A Quotient Gradient System-Based Trust-Tech Method for Computing Distinct Feasible Solutions Located in Multiple/All Feasible Components of ACOPF Models: Theory and Methodology"**

The proposed method integrates the Quotient Gradient System (QGS) with Trust-Tech techniques to compute multiple or all distinct feasible solutions across different feasible components of Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) models.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `case/`: Test case data files.
- `ipopt_func/`: Functions integrating the IPOPT solver.
- `mips_func/`: Functions integrating the MIPS solver.
- `review1_comment4.m`: MATLAB script addressing reviewer comments.
